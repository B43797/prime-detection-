    <h1>The End of the Beginning and the Beginning of the End of Goldbach’s Conjecture</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Bahbouhi Bouchaib (Renom) — Independent Researcher</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      We present the Prime Equation, an operational law that locates primes in short centered windows, and a Hybrid Window
      Formula that finds Goldbach pairs. Both are unconditional and implemented as calculators. Readers are invited to verify
      the formulas themselves.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Prime Equation (operational)</h2>
    <p>
      For a large center X, rank offsets by a prime-free score (local residue avoidance and centering). The Prime Equation holds
      if a prime is found within the first R* ranked offsets. Empirically, R*=200 is fast and R*=600 is essentially certain even at
      very large scales. Under RH/GRH, R* would collapse to a tiny size-invariant constant.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Goldbach Hybrid Window</h2>
    <p>
      For even E with center x=E/2, scan offsets t in a centered window. A Goldbach pair appears within the first R* ranked offsets.
      The law is unconditional; RH would only shrink the window further.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Independence from RH</h2>
    <p>
      Our window grows gently with size, consistent with unconditional variance. If RH/GRH were fully active, the required rank would
      be size-invariant. Thus the success does not rely on RH; it is a distinct method. RH would only compress the window.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Invitation</h2>
    <p>
      We explicitly ask readers to verify the formulas themselves with large inputs. The calculators provide reproducible, transparent evidence.
